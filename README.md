# 🫁 Visual Analytics for Lung Cancer Risk Factors

This project explores the relationships between various risk factors and lung cancer occurrence using a clean and interactive set of **visual analytics**. The dataset includes medical and behavioral indicators such as smoking, anxiety, chest pain, coughing, and more.

---

## 📊 Objective

To identify which factors are most strongly associated with lung cancer using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations. The project aims to support better decision-making and early diagnosis by highlighting key patterns.
